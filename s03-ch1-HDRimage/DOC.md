# Step03 - Raster image output
I didn't know what image to generate so I decided to just get a simple renderer working.  
It currently renders a single sphere and a plane with a single directional light source.  
Everything is currently hard-coded but it's all object oriented so it shouldn't be hard to change stuff. I was just lazy to implement more config parsing.  
The only things that are affected by the config file at this moment are the dimensions of the output image and the background color.

Even though I almost have everything for checkpoint #2, I still have to change a bunch of stuff to get it working properly so I really think of this as only checkpoint #1.

(Also, I forgot to make a branch for the ckeckpoint, I'll start doing that with the next one)
